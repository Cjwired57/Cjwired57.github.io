      <h1>SQL Basics Cheat Sheet</h1>
      <p>SQL stands for "Structured Query Language" and is a language designed to help manage the data you have stored in relational databases.  While there are several relational database management systems, this cheat sheet will focus on SQLite and provide a list of important SQL commands for future reference.</p>

        <h2>CREATING TABLES</h2>
        <p>To create a table from scratch you use the CREATE statement.  As a clause, CREATE TABLE will tell SQL that you want to create a new table.  As you can see below, that clause is followed by the table name, which is followed by the fields (or columns) you would like the table to include, along with the datatype of the column.</p>

        <details>
          <summary><code> CREATE TABLE animals (id INTEGER, species TEXT, class TEXT);</code></summary>
          <p>Above we have created a table with fields id, species, and class.  It's important to remember to follow every SQL statement with a semicolon, if you forget it though, just add one on the next line.</p>
        </details>

      <article>
        <h2>INSERTING ROWS</h2>
        <p>An INSERT statement will insert rows into a field/column. By using the INSERT INTO clause you can add the specified row(s).</p>

        <details>
          <summary><code> INSERT INTO animals (id, species, class) VALUES (1, "homo_sapien", "mammal");</code></summary>
          <summary><code> INSERT INTO animals (id, species, class) VALUES (2, "garter_snake", "amphibian");</code></summary>
          <summary><code> INSERT INTO animals (id, species, class) VALUES (3, "great_white_shark", "cartilaginous_fish");</code></summary>
          <p>By using the INSERT INTO clause and specifying the columns id, species and class, we can use the VALUES statement to input the data for each field in our new rows.  Above we have added humans, garter snakes, and great white sharks to the database.</p>
        </details>

      </article>

      <article>
        <h2>SELECT</h2>
        <p>You can use a SELECT statement to fetch specific pieces of data from the database.</p>

        <details>
          <summary><code>SELECT species FROM animals;</code></summary>
          <p>After we initiate the query with SELECT we specify which column we want to query data from, and FROM tells us which table we want to fetch the data from...here it is the species column of the animals table.</p>
          <p>You can also use * as a wildcard taht allows you to select all of the columns of a table, so that you don't have to name each one individually. You can see it being used below:</p>
          <summary><code>SELECT * FROM animals;</code></summary>
        </details>

      </article>

      <article>
        <h2>UPDATE</h2>
        <p>By using an UPDATE statement we can edit a row inside of a table using the SET and WHERE clauses</p>

        <details>
          <summary><code>UPDATE animals SET class = "reptile" WHERE id = 2;</code></summary>
          <p>Here we have corrected the info on garter snake by changing its class from amphibian to reptile.</p>
        </details>

      </article>

      <article>
        <h2>ALTER TABLE</h2>
        <p>An ALTER TABLE statement lets you add a new column to the table by using the ADD COLUMN clause and specifying what data type the column will contain.</p>

        <details>
          <summary><code>ALTER TABLE animals ADD COLUMN conservation_status TEXT;</code></summary>
          <p>Here we have added another column to the table that tells us what the conservation status of each species is.  We can now use what we learned with UPDATE to fill in the missing values for the new column.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary><code>UPDATE animals SET conservation_status = "least_concern" WHERE id = 1;</code></summary>
          <summary><code>UPDATE animals SET conservation_status = "least_concern" WHERE id = 2;</code></summary>
          <summary><code>UPDATE animals SET conservation_status = "vulnerable" WHERE id = 3;</code></summary>
        </details>

      </article>

      <article>
        <h2>DELETE</h2>
        <p>The DELETE FROM statement lets you delete a row or rows from your table by using WHERE.</p>

        <details>
          <summary><code>DELETE FROM animals WHERE id = 1;</code></summary>
          <p>Here we have deleted the humans row from our database!</p>
        </details>

      </article>

      <article>
        <h2>SELECT DISTINCT</h2>
        <p>This query will return unique values in the specified column(s).</p>

        <details>
          <summary><code>SELECT DISTINCT conservation_status FROM animals;</code></summary>
          <p>Because we have only one unique value in the conservation status field, this statement will return the "vulnerable" value from the Great White Shark row.</p>
          <p>You can also use the wildcard character '_' which means that any character can be substituted without breaking the pattern.  So say we had "great_green_shark" then </p>
        </details>

      </article>

      <article>
        <h2>Using WHERE with Operators</h2>
        <p>It's important to know that when using the WHERE clause you can use all of the operators that we have become familiar with so far (=, !=, >, <, >=, <=, etc.  We've already seen WHERE paired with the "=" operator above, but it's useful to know that you can further specify using these other operators.</p>

      </article>

      <article>
        <h2>LIKE</h2>
        <p>LIKE is what we call a special operator and is super useful in our SQL queries. Used in conjunction with WHERE we can use LIKE to compare similar values.</p>

        <details>
          <summary><code>SELECT * FROM animals WHERE species LIKE 'g%';</code></summary>
          <p>'%' is another wildcard that will match zero or more missing letters in the pattern.  So, the above statement would return both garter_snake and great_white_shark since both values begin with the letter "g".  This wildcard can be added before the letter, in which case all values ending in the specified letter would be returned. </p>
          <p>You can also use the wildcard character '_' which means that any character can be substituted without breaking the pattern.  So say we had the imaginary animal "great_green_shark" then used the statement WHERE name like 'g________________'... this would return both the great_white AND the great_green species data, because the number of characters are the same. </p>
        </details>

      </article>

      <article>
        <h2>BETWEEN</h2>
        <p>BETWEEN is another special operator used in conjunction with AND that will filter the results within a certain range.</p>

        <details>
          <summary><code>SELECT * FROM animals WHERE id BETWEEN 1 AND 2;</code></summary>
          <p>Using the where clause, above we have targeted all rows with id numbers between 1 up to and including 2. </p>
        </details>

      </article>

      <article>
        <h2>AND and OR</h2>
        <p>AND can also be used to establish another condition when using the WHERE clause.  See the example below.</p>

        <details>
          <summary><code>SELECT * FROM animals WHERE id BETWEEN 1 AND 2 AND species LIKE 'g%';</code></summary>
          <p>Using the AND operator, we have now created two separate conditions that must be met for a row to be returned. First the ID number must fall within the range established by the BETWEEN operator, and finally the name must begin with the letter 'g'.  If both conditions are met, as is the case with the species garter_snake, then the row will be returned by the query. the OR operator can be used in a similar way, allowing the query to be returned if one or both of the two conditions have been met.</p>
        </details>

      </article>

      <article>
        <h2>ORDER BY</h2>
        <p>ORDER BY is used in conjunction with keywords ASC and DESC to help you sort your query.  The ORDER BY clause lets you sort the result of a specific column either alphabetically or numerically.</p>

        <details>
          <summary><code>SELECT * FROM animals ORDER BY species ASC;</code></summary>
          <p>The above statement will return the rows in an alphabetical order based on their value in the species column.  Because the letter 'g' is higher up the alphabet than 'g', the homo_sapien species will be dropped to the bottom of the list.</p>
        </details>
        <p>You can also set a limit to your QUERY using the LIMIT clause followed by a numerical value.</p>
        <details>
          <summary><code>SELECT * FROM animals ORDER BY species ASC LIMIT 2;</code></summary>
          <p>By setting LIMIT at 2, this query will only return the top two rows alphabetically, so both garter_snake and great_white_shark. </p>
        </details>
