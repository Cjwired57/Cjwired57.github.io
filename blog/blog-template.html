The Dalton Gang was a group of outlaws in the American Old West during 1890â€“1892. It was also known as The Dalton Brothers because three of its members were brothers. The gang specialized in bank and train robberies. During an attempted bank robbery in Coffeyville, Kansas in 1892, two of the brothers and two other gang members were killed; Emmett survived and was captured, tried, and convicted. He was paroled after serving 14 years in prison.
The oldest brother Frank had been a Deputy U.S. Marshal, but was killed in 1888. In 1890, Gratton "Grat", Bob, and Emmett turned to crime after not being paid as lawmen. Their middle brother William M. "Bill" Dalton also had a career as an outlaw, but he rode with the Wild Bunch. The gangs were related through their mother to the Younger brothers, who rode with Jesse James. The Daltons were active later and independently of the James-Younger Gang.

  -Wireframing/creating an HTML page with a pair was very helpful...it gave us a chance to compare our preferred wireframing tools...and there were a few features to my blog I would have forgotten about adding.  Was also introduced to the emmett plugin for sublime which I now can't reccommend highly enough.
  -Yes wireframing is very helpful for my process.  I definitely want to play around with some more tools (i.e. illustrator/fireworks) to find one I really enjoy using.  Even though my individual blog post was incredibly straightforward in its layout, it was still helpful to go into it with an outline/plan.  My HTML skeleton still doesn't resemble the blog I've envisioned, but hopefully with some CSS practice next week I'll be able to make some final changes.
  -We went for a pretty straightforward design that had a header/footer with a navigation bar to other parts of the site, a search bar, social media buttons...Then the body contains the blog text with placeholders for images, a header and a date/time stamp.
  -I learned about nav, section, article and summary.
Here's a link to my wireframe image: https://github.com/Cjwired57/Cjwired57.github.io/blob/master/imgs/wireframe-blogs.png
