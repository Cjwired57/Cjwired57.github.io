        There are many benefits to version control.  When developers are working together, version control is crucial in allowing team members to work on the same project simultaneously and in tracking each change that a developer makes along the way.

          Git is essential for version control, as it is software that equips file folders on your system with version control.  All folders on your computer can become a Git repository.  When you use Git to convert your folder to a repository, it creates a secret directory .git.  Once the .git folder is installed in your folder, it provides version control through some basic git controls i.e. git commit.

        Github is a cloud-based repository management system.  What that means is that you can store your code to the cloud, safely backing it up in the event that anything might happen to your computer.  Say your computer gets stolen, or suffers spontaneous defenstration, your code will still be safely stored on Github.  GitHub also provides you with a history of changes and facilitates sharing your code with other developers.
