**What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margins by doing this challenge?**
I solidified my understanding of the differences between each.  The borders are the boundaries of the element.  Adjusting the margins changes the position of the element relative to the position of other things, such as the boundaries of the webpage itself.  The padding is the space between the content and the border.

**What did you learn about CSS positioning?**
I was able to practice using the fixed position attribute for my header, allowing the header to stay at the top of the webpage even while scrolling.

**What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement?**
I guess the easiest design changes I made were with color and font choices.

**What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?**
I learned how crucial it is to split as many things up into div categories to keep organized and to have more reference points when adding css.  I also became much more familiar with chrome dev tools, and found myself using them before making any changes to my css.
